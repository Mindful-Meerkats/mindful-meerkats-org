## Open collective

Mindful Meerkats is organised as an open collective of individuals. Open means that we invite any individual who shares the same \[vision\](README.md) to join us. Mindful Meerkats does not earn any money directly and releases all its ideas under an open license. Therefore, to work on our vision, each member of the collective contributes financially to meet the \[financial requirements\](financial\_requirements) of each of the members of Mindful Meerkats. This system enables the collective to provide an unconditional basic income to its members. We welcome donations from individuals and organisations to help us support our members to do purposeful work for the commons.
