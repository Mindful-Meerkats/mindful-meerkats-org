<p>Can we stimulate people to live more mindfully by playing a game to contribute to a more sustainable world? A small team of sustainable developers & web designers has taken up the challenge to create a beautiful web game that inspires mindfulness.
</p>

<p>
In the Mindful Meerkats smartphone game, schools join the challenge to become the most mindful school. Every student creates his personal meerkat avatar that reflects his well-being. All students together reflect the well-being of their school colony compared to other schools. Schools receives a weekly game challenge that is connected to real-life activities which have a positive impact on the students and their environment. Students join the challenges in teams and the results are reflected in the avatar & give more options to personalise it. 
</p>

<!-- <p>We distinguish four different types of people (see attached .gif
animation) that we want to reach and inspire for sustainability. They
all have different reasons not to become engaged with sustainability
by themselves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Ignorant is aware of the problem of unsustainabilities but does
not see any reason to act. In the game he needs to be addressed by
game actions that enhance his personal well-being whilst
simultaneously stimulating positive effects for his
socio-environmental surrounding;</li>
  <li>The Unaware is not even aware of the problem. In the game he needs
to be addressed by positive (stimuli) game actions that let him
reflect on his own contribution to the problem;</li>
  <li>The Unknowledgable is aware of the problem but does not know any
solution to act upon. In the game he needs to be addressed by game
actions that provide him with knowledge to act more mindful in the
future;</li>
  <li>The Delegator is aware of the problem, might even know a solution,
but delegates the responsibility to third-parties, e.g. the
government. In the game he needs to be addressed by game actions that
empower his actions and show him how easy it is to contribute to a
sustainable change;</li>
</ul>  -->

<p>Everyone likes to play, everyone like to have fun, so do we believe that we
can inspire you to become Mindful Meerkats. We want to let you play
an enjoyable game with underlying sustainable principles:</p>
